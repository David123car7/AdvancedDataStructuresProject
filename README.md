# Advanced Data Structures Project (

This project was developed for the course **Advanced Data Structures (EDA)** in the **Computer Systems Engineering** degree at IPCA.
The goal is to apply **graph theory** and programming in C to solve an optimization problem involving integer matrices.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goals

- Implement a **dynamic graph structure (GR)** that supports:
  - Directed graphs with a variable number of vertices.
  - Adding and removing vertices and edges.
- Model an **integer matrix** as a graph:
  - Each element of the matrix corresponds to a vertex.
  - Edges represent connections defined by adjacency rules (e.g., same row or column, no diagonals).
- Implement search algorithms (**DFS/BFS**) to explore valid paths.
- Calculate the **path with the maximum sum of integers**, returning:
  - The maximum sum found.
  - The corresponding path(s).
